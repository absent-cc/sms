## What is it?
An SMS schoology 🤖 bot that 💬 texts NPS students when their  👩‍🏫 teachers are 📝 absent. Supports both Newton high schools, 🐯[Newton South](https://www.newton.k12.ma.us/nshs) & 🦁[Newton North](https://www.newton.k12.ma.us/nnhs).

Running on a 🐍Python based server, it uses the [Schoolopy](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/schoolopy) API to grab teacher absences from Schoology, which is processed and then texted through using the [PyTextNow](https://github.com/leogomezz4t/PyTextNow_API) API to the students who have absent teachers.

## How does it work?
Students sign up by 💬 texting abSENT's phone number and inputting their 📅 schedule. The schedule is then saved as an SQLite database using 5 tables:

- One table stores students and their characteristics (name and phone number)
- Another stores teachers and their characteristics (name)
- The third table is an array of classes that maps teacher & block -> student. 
- The remaining tables are relational that connect the class IDs to student IDs, and class IDs to teacher IDs. 

Every school day, abSENT retrives the day's 👨‍🏫 teacher absences and then queries the SQLite database by teacher ID and block to find students who have absent teachers. These students are then notifed over 💬 text that their teacher is absent.

## Why?
We got sick of checking schoology 😋 and luckily, we know how to \*somewhat\* write code.

abSENT as a project is not affiliated with any of the entities who's students it serves. We are students and have written this project just for fun, as a minor QOL improvement in the morning.
